    "Data science is all around us. It is an interdisciplinary field of study that strives to discover meaning behind data. Finding a good first data science project to work on is a hard task. You may know a lot of data science concepts but you get stuck when you want to apply your skills to real world tasks. However, you've come to the right place! Have you ever wanted to make an application that could distinguish between some bad thing and a good thing? This tutorial will do just that. It's actually a basic introduction to the world of data science. This project will teach you how to create a spam classifier/filter that will distinguish between spam vs. not spam (we call this ham) SMS messages. We will take you through the entire data science lifecycle which includes data collection, data processing, exploratory data analysis and visualization, analysis, hypothesis testing, machine learning and insight/policy decision."
